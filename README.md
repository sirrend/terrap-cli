Simplify your Provider version upgrades with **Terrap** - a powerful CLI tool that scans your system and identifies any required changes. </br>
The tool offers clear and actionable notifications, helping you streamline the upgrade process and avoid any potential errors or complications.</br></br>
üîç **Terrap is an alpha version project, therefore some data might be partial.**

## Resources
* Documentation - <a href="https://www.sirrend.com/terrap-docs">sirrend.com/terrap-docs</a>

## Constraints üß±
1. Supported Terraform Core versions: `>=0.13`.
2. Every provider which uses `Terraform Core 0.13` or higher.

## Good To Know üí°
Terrap decides which Terraform version to use in the following order:
1. The latest installed Terraform version found locally.
2. If the `TERRAP_TERRAFORM_VERSION` environment variable is set, Terrap will use the version specified as long as it matches the `>=0.13` constraint.</br>
    Set environment variable on mac/linux:</br>
    ```shell
   export <var>=<value>
   ```
   Set environment variable on windows:</br>
    ```shell
   $Env:TERRAP_TERRAFORM_VERSION = "0.13"
   ```
   
4. If none of the above is applicable, Terrap will download the latest available version.

## How to Download ‚¨áÔ∏è
### Clone sirrend/terrap-cli
```shell
git clone https://github.com/sirrend/terrap-cli
cd terrap-cli

go build -o terrap .

chmod +x terrap
mv terrap /usr/local/bin/
```

### Brew
```shell
brew tap sirrend/sirrend
brew install terrap
```

Validate terrap is working by executing `terrap`.

## Quick Start ‚è©

### Initialize my First Workspace
1. `CD` to the local Terraform folder you want to work with.</br>
   `cd < /terraform/folder/path >`</br></br>

2. Initialize a new Terrap workspace where you would run terraform apply with `terrap init`.</br></br>
    <strong>Important!</strong> </br>
    As Terrap runs <code>terraform init</code> under the hood, it would need every configuration component you normally use when executing the command.</br>
    It can be environment variables, the <code>.aws/credentials</code> file, etc.


3. Scan your workspace with: `terrap scan`
