Simplify your Provider version upgrades with **Terrap** - a powerful CLI tool that scans your system and identifies any required changes. </br>
The tool offers clear and actionable notifications, helping you streamline the upgrade process and avoid any potential errors or complications.</br></br>
üîç Terrap is an alpha version project, therefore some data might be partial.

## Constraints üß±
1. Supported Terraform Core versions: `>=0.13`.
2. Every provider which uses `Terraform Core 0.13` or higher.

## Good To Know üí°
Terrap decides which Terraform version to use in the following order:
1. The latest installed Terraform version found locally.
2. If the `TERRAP_TERRAFORM_VERSION` environment variable is set, Terrap will use the version specified as long as it matches the `>=0.13` constraint.
3. If none of the above is applicable, Terrap will download the latest available version.

## How to Download ‚¨áÔ∏è
#### Clone sirrend/terrap-cli
```shell
git clone https://github.com/sirrend/terrap-cli
cd terrap-cli

go build -o terrap .

```
